## Cam's Kaggle Code

This repository contains some of the code I use in Kaggle data science/machine learning tasks.

Where appliciable I keep all the code/data from a single competition within one a folder. i.e. 'california_housing' will have the California Housing dataset along with any kernels or code that work with that data.
To avoid bulk I don't have copies of all the datasets, so some scripts are alone in the main folder. To use these you can head over to Kaggle and download a copy of the relevant data.
